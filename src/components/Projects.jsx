                The Todo List app on React helps users keep track of tasks in
                three sections - To Do, Done, and Trash. It allows adding,
                editing, and deleting tasks with the option to filter and sort
                them by status, helping users stay organized and productive.

                &#10026; In this ToDo List pet project, I utilized the useState
                and useEffect Hooks provided by React to manage state and handle
                side effects, and implemented the JavaScript filter method to
                filter tasks based on their status, enabling users to easily
                sort and view their tasks based on their current status, making
                it easier to manage their workload.

                My insurance agency project is a React-based web application
                that features a pricing section, where users can compare and
                choose insurance plans. Using the Axios library, the pricing
                section maps the values and displays them in a user-friendly
                manner. This project offers an efficient and user-friendly
                solution for individuals seeking reliable insurance services.
